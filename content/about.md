Hi! My name is Kento Yamada, and I am a junior at Harvard College studying Government. The purpose of this blog is to predict the outcomes of the 2022 Congressional midterm elections. Each week, I will post a blog on a topic related to election analytics, and I will attempt to refine my predictive models until the elections take place in November. This blog was written as part of "Government 1347: Election Analytics."
