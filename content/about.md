Hi! My name is Kento Yamada, and I am a junior at Harvard College studying Government. The purpose of this blog is to predict the outcomes of the 2022 midterm elections. Focusing on the House of Representatives elections, each week, I will post a blog to share various predictive models. I will continue to refine the models until the elections take place in November, and after the elections, I will reflect on my predictions. This blog was written as part of "Government 1347: Election Analytics."
